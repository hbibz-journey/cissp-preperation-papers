# note 1 : Domain 1 : Information Security governance and risk management

risk terms for C-level excecutives :
		ToTal Cost of Ownership : TCO
		Return On Investment    : ROI

CIA triad :
		Confidentiality         : preventing unauthorized read access to data
			ex : PII - Personally identifiable Information (CC infos)
		Integrity               : preventing unauthorized modification of:
						data : data integrity violation
						system : system integrity violation
		Availability            : ensuring that data is available when needed and systems are usable
			ex : DOS - Denial of Service
	Its opposite is DAD             : Disclosure
					  Alteration
					  Destruction

AAA       :
	Authentication : proving identity claim
	Authorization  : performed actions when authenticated 
				you can be : Authorized  : permission granted
					     Unauthorized: permission denied
	Accountability : logging data for identification and sanctionning (punishing) violators - making users accountables for their actions
  Identification is required before 'AAA'

Nonrepudiation : a mix of athentication and integrity

Defense-in-depth: layered defenses : when one safeguard fails an asset will not be compromised

Risk analysis (RA) : asessing risk for the wisest choice (solution) and mitigating risks and threts on an asset
	 bad RA --> wasted money / comprimised data or both 
|
 >Determining asset value helps with RA
                  |
		   >data / systems / people / buildings / property ... : people are the most valuable

Threats and vulnerablities :
	Threat       :  potential harmful occurence, a negative action that may harm an asset
			ex : earthquakes/ floods/ network-based worms ...
	Vulnerability: a weakness that allows a threat to cause harm
Formula of THREAT:
	--> Risk is threat * vulnerability
	This formula may include impact :
	---> Risk = threat * vulnerability * impact
						|
						.> consequences : the severity of the damage 
			PS: human lives has near-infinite impact ; a risk with human lives loss is extremely high : must be mitigated
